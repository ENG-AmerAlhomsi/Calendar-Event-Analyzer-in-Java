This Java program manages a calendar represented by a 2D array. It performs the following tasks:

Event Detection and Counting per Week:
It iterates through each week and each day within that week, detecting and counting events. For each non-empty cell in the calendar array, it prints the week number, day number, and the corresponding event. It also calculates and prints the total number of events for each week.

Event Counting per Weekday:
It then counts the total number of events for each weekday. It iterates through each weekday column in the calendar array, counting the non-empty cells. The results are printed with the corresponding weekday names.

The program demonstrates a practical use case of nested loops, conditional statements, and array manipulation in Java to analyze and report on a calendar's event schedule.
